# 👋 Greetings, I'm Arun!

📊 Currently, I'm on the journey to complete my Master's degree in Business Analytics at the University of Iowa.

## **🌱 Exploring the world of data:**

• **Iowa Case Competition 2023:** I'm excited to share our success in the University of Iowa team's remarkable fourth-place finish in a challenging Analytics Case Competition. Our task revolved around analyzing demand forecast methodologies for Heineken. This experience provided deep insights into demand forecasting strategies, effective teamwork, and practical problem-solving within the realm of analytics.

• **CFA Challenge 2022:** Participating in the recent CFA Institute Research Challenge, a global annual competition offering hands-on mentoring and intensive training in financial analysis and professional ethics, was both a challenge and a joy. Despite having no prior financial education or experience, I relished every moment of analysis and financial modeling discussions.

## **🏋🏻‍♀️ Navigating leadership paths:**

• **Treasurer of the Music Club at NITC (undergraduate university):** I had the privilege of overseeing the club's finances, ensuring their responsible allocation. This involved crafting an annual budget and managing expenses through the college's Finance Department. I also handled instrument and equipment procurement, actively participating in tender applications.

• **Treasurer of the Industrial and Planning Forum (IPF) at NITC:** I meticulously managed fund flows, maintained the club's bank account, and monitored cash on hand. My primary focus was maintaining accurate expenditure records. Moreover, I orchestrated the NITC Model United Nations at the Grand Hotel in Kochi in 2017 and on the NITC campus in 2018. I collaborated with the Training & Placement Department to host diverse programs.

🍳 **Culinary Journey:** A culinary aficionado, I specialize in crafting Italian and Indian cuisines.

⚽ **Sports Aficionado:** I'm engaged in various sports as both a spectator and a participant. Whether it's tennis, cricket, badminton, or F1 racing – count me in for the excitement!
