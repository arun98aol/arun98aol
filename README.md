## Hey, Welcome to my Github profile!

As of October 2024, I'm building an Agent 'Hope' at CareerX, Inc. Hope showcases the best Agentic AI has to offer job seekers in 2024.

### **What is [CareerX](https://www.careerx.app)?**

At CareerX, Inc., I‚Äôm the Founder & CTO, where we‚Äôre rethinking how people showcase their skills. Instead of boring, static resumes, we‚Äôre building a dynamic platform that focuses on "skill stories" ‚Äî how people actually use their skills in real life.

The idea came from my own frustration with traditional career platforms. So, I decided to build a solution where AI helps connect the dots between skills and real-world applications. We use Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and semantic search to manage and validate skill data with a system of agents that talk to each other to ensure everything is on point.

What‚Äôs even cooler? I'm a Level 3 Founder backed by Microsoft for Startups (worth up to $250K!). It‚Äôs been an amazing ride so far, blending my passion for AI and helping people tell their unique career stories in a more meaningful way.
